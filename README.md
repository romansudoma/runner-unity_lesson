This game was a part of a practical lesson in the book "Unity Game Development in 24 Hours" by Mike Geig.

In this game, the player runs on a platform until time runs out. On the platform, two types of objects spawn. The first type is a sun, which adds extra time to the timer. The second type is an obstacle that slows down the player and other objects on the platform.
